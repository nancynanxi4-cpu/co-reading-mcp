# MCP Tools

## `reading_list_books`

Returns all imported books with progress and annotation counts. Annotation counts are cached by `annotations.jsonl` file signature so repeated calls do not re-parse the JSONL file unless it changes.

## `reading_list_chunks`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines" }
```

Returns chunks in reading order, including `prevId`, `nextId`, `read`, and `annotationCount`.

## `reading_read_chunk`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines", "chunkId": "ch00" }
```

Returns the chunk text plus neighboring ids.

## `reading_continue`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines" }
```

`bookId` is optional. When omitted, the server uses the most recently read book.

Returns the next unread chunk after `lastChunkId`. If `lastChunkId` is missing or stale, it falls back to the first unread chunk. If the book is already complete, it returns `completed: true` and a progress summary instead of chunk text.

## `reading_search_chunks`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines", "query": "values", "limit": 10 }
```

Returns matching snippets.

Chunk text is cached by file signature after first read. Search is still a simple substring scan, but repeated searches avoid re-reading every chunk from disk.

## `reading_import_book`

Input:

```json
{
  "filename": "book.epub",
  "dataBase64": "...",
  "bookId": "optional-stable-id",
  "overwrite": false
}
```

Imports one EPUB or TXT/Markdown file from base64 content. Use this when the file fits inside one MCP request. `dataBase64` can be raw base64 or a `data:*;base64,...` URL.

For TXT/Markdown imports, optional fields mirror `scripts/import_text.py`:

```json
{
  "filename": "book.txt",
  "dataBase64": "...",
  "title": "Book Title",
  "author": "Author",
  "headingRegex": "^Chapter\\s+\\w+",
  "minSectionChars": 100,
  "maxChars": 6000
}
```

The server validates the file type, upload size, and `bookId`, writes the book into `data/books`, and returns the imported `bookId`, title, and chunk count.

## `reading_delete_book`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines", "confirm": true }
```

Deletes a book from the active library. This is a soft delete: the book folder and removed active records are archived under `data/trash/books/...`.

The active `progress.json`, `annotations.jsonl`, `submissions.jsonl`, `cards.jsonl`, and session context ledger are rewritten without records for that book, so re-importing the same `bookId` starts cleanly. The tool requires `confirm: true` to avoid accidental deletion. Trash is pruned after 30 days by default; set `READING_TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS=0` to keep trash forever.

## Chunked Import

Use chunked import when a file is too large for one JSON-RPC body.

1. Start:

```json
{
  "filename": "large.epub",
  "expectedBytes": 1234567,
  "bookId": "large-book"
}
```

Call `reading_import_begin` and keep the returned `uploadId`.

2. Append base64 parts:

```json
{
  "uploadId": "...",
  "index": 0,
  "dataBase64": "..."
}
```

Call `reading_import_part` once per binary part. Each part should be independently base64-encoded; do not split a single base64 string at arbitrary characters.

3. Finish:

```json
{ "uploadId": "..." }
```

Call `reading_import_finish` to run the importer. Use `reading_import_cancel` to discard an unfinished upload.

## `reading_annotate_passage`

Input:

```json
{
  "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines",
  "chunkId": "ch00",
  "quote": "this line matters",
  "quoteOffset": 42,
  "note": "This is a resonance note.",
  "author": "claude",
  "kind": "resonance",
  "mood": "quiet",
  "tags": ["identity"],
  "status": "published",
  "parentId": null
}
```

Writes one JSONL annotation. `quoteOffset` is optional, but a reader UI should send it when available so repeated text is anchored to the selected occurrence instead of the first matching quote. If the quote is present in the chunk, the returned object includes a `quoteOffset`. Root annotations also return `annotationIndexInBook`, `annotationIndexInChunk`, and a short `message` such as “Saved annotation 12 in this book.”

For a user-facing reading app, create user notes with:

```json
{
  "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines",
  "chunkId": "ch00",
  "quote": "this line matters",
  "quoteOffset": 42,
  "note": "I want Claude to comment on this.",
  "author": "user",
  "status": "open"
}
```

## `reading_list_annotations`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines", "chunkId": "ch00", "kind": "resonance", "status": "published" }
```

All fields are optional except `bookId` in most practical use.

By default this tool hides human notes with `status: "open"`, `"private"`, or `"draft"` and hides replies under those private notes. This lets a reader save notes and leave without exposing them to Claude. A trusted local UI can pass `includePrivate: true`; Claude-facing MCP clients should not.

## `reading_submit_user_notes`

Input:

```json
{
  "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines",
  "sessionId": "claude-session-2026-05-22",
  "contextMode": "chunk-once-per-session"
}
```

Finds all user annotations with `status: "open"`, `"private"`, or `"draft"`, returns them as one batch for Claude, and rewrites them to `status: "submitted"` so the same notes are not sent again.

This is the tool a companion app or Claude-facing integration should call when the user taps “Send notes to Claude”. In the built-in browser reader, this action publishes the private notes so Claude can retrieve them through MCP and returns the context package to the HTTP caller; it is not a push notification into claude.ai by itself.

By default, `contextMode` is `chunk-once-per-session`: the first submitted user note for a chunk includes that chunk's full text in `context.chunks`. Later notes for the same chunk and `sessionId` only send the new notes, with the repeated chunk listed in `context.omittedChunks`. A new `sessionId` starts fresh and includes the chunk again.

Supported context modes:

- `chunk-once-per-session`: default; send each chunk once per Claude session
- `chunk-always`: include full chunk text every time
- `notes-only`: send only the submitted notes and quote anchors

Set `forceChunkContext: true` to re-send chunk text inside the same session.

Each successful submit also writes a submission batch. Use `reading_list_submissions` to find recent shared batches and `reading_read_submission` to read one batch with notes and context.

## `reading_list_submissions`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines", "limit": 10 }
```

Returns recent human note submission summaries. The summary includes `id`, `submittedAt`, note ids, chunk ids, and a compact context summary.

## `reading_read_submission`

Input:

```json
{ "submissionId": "sub_..." }
```

Returns one submitted batch with its notes and context package.

## `reading_reply_to_annotation`

Input:

```json
{
  "parentId": "ann_guidelines_user_001",
  "note": "Claude's reply under this user note.",
  "kind": "reply",
  "status": "published"
}
```

Claude-facing MCP replies are published immediately. Human replies typed in the built-in web reader are created through the HTTP API as `status: "open"` and stay staged until the reader clicks `Send to Claude`.

Creates a Claude annotation with `parentId` pointing to the original note. If `bookId`, `chunkId`, or `quote` are omitted, they are inherited from the parent annotation.

## `reading_mark_read`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines", "chunkId": "ch00" }
```

Marks a chunk as read and updates `lastChunkId`. The response includes `chunksRead`, `chunkCount`, `complete`, and a human-readable `message`.

When the marked chunk completes the book, the response also includes:

```json
{
  "finish": {
    "annotationCount": 32,
    "moodCounts": { "quiet": 4 },
    "kindCounts": { "resonance": 12, "feeling": 5 },
    "celebration": {
      "title": "Book finished, margins preserved.",
      "line": "The reading is done; the conversation can keep unfolding from any note.",
      "prompt": "Write a short closing note that feels like placing a bookmark after the final page."
    },
    "message": "Congratulations, Book Title is complete: 43/43 chunks, 32 annotations."
  }
}
```

`finish.celebration` is intentionally small and variable. Claude can use it as a closing ritual, or a frontend can ignore it and keep only the stable counts.

## `reading_collect_card`

Input:

```json
{
  "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines",
  "chunkId": "ch00",
  "kicker": "收获了一枚回声书签",
  "title": "Book Title",
  "quote": "a sentence worth carrying forward",
  "note": "Why this passage became a card.",
  "art": "fold"
}
```

Collects a small ritual reading card/bookmark for later. `art` can be `fold`, `ripple`, or `stardust`. Use this for completed sections, shared-margin moments, or quiet passages worth carrying forward.

## `reading_card_inbox`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines", "limit": 10 }
```

Returns only unread card prompts, such as “收获了一枚回声书签”, with the `cardId` needed to open or dismiss them. This is the reader-facing flow Claude should use instead of reading raw card data.

## `reading_open_card`

Input:

```json
{ "cardId": "card_..." }
```

Returns the selected card as image content so Claude can view it directly. If Playwright Chromium is installed, the card is rendered as a polished PNG from the same HTML/CSS card template used by the reader; otherwise the server falls back to an SVG image. The text part is only a short caption.

## `reading_save_card`

Input:

```json
{ "cardId": "card_..." }
```

Renders the selected card to a local image file and returns its absolute path plus `mimeType`. Use this when the host client can send local files after MCP returns a path.

## `reading_dismiss_card`

Input:

```json
{ "cardId": "card_..." }
```

Marks a card as dismissed so it no longer appears in `reading_card_inbox`. The card remains in `cards.jsonl` and can still be found with `reading_list_cards`.

## `reading_list_cards`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines", "limit": 10 }
```

Lists collected cards, newest first. Cards are stored separately from annotations in `cards.jsonl`, so they can act like lightweight bookmarks instead of new margin notes.

## `reading_get_progress`

Input:

```json
{ "bookId": "anthropic-guidelines" }
```
